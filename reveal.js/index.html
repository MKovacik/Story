						The transformer architecture is a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in
						2017 by Google. for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation. It is based
						on the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different
						parts of the input sequence when computing the representation of each element in the sequence.

						&ldquo;When we train a large neural network, we are learning a world model.
						It looks like we are just learning statistical correlations in text
						but it turns out that to just learn the statistical correlations is to compress it really well.
						What the neural network learns is some representation of the process that produced the text.
						This text is actually a projection of the world [...] and so what the neural network is learning is more and more aspects of the world,
						of people [...] their hopes, dreams, and motivations, their interactions and situations.
						The neural network learns a compressed, abstract, usable representation of that [...] from accurately predicting the next word.&rdquo;
